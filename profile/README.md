# âš¡ payload.wtf

**Solana transactions, tipped and turbocharged.**

`payload.wtf` is an edge-native routing layer for Solana transactions. It enables faster inclusion, priority lanes, and MEV-protected routing with zero protocol changes â€” just by wrapping your existing `sendTransaction` flow.

We provide lightweight SDKs to help you route transactions through the `payload.wtf` network while automatically handling tip logic, RPC lane selection, and transaction forwarding.

## ðŸš€ What is payload.wtf?

`payload.wtf` is a Solana-compatible API that:

- Accepts standard base64-encoded `sendTransaction` payloads
- Enforces a tip-based routing policy
- Routes transactions to high-performance RPC providers like QuickNode, Helius, or Jito
- Drops transactions that don't meet tip thresholds
- Logs telemetry for land rate, block inclusion rate, and tip volume

All without changing your Solana codebase â€” just send to a new endpoint.
