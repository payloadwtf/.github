# âš¡ payloadwtf

**Solana transactions, tipped and turbocharged.**

`payload.wtf` is an edge-native routing layer for Solana transactions. It enables faster inclusion, priority lanes, and MEV-protected routing with zero protocol changes â€” just by wrapping your existing `sendTransaction` flow.

We provide lightweight SDKs to help you route transactions through the `payload.wtf` network while automatically handling tip logic, RPC lane selection, and transaction forwarding.

## ðŸš€ What is payload.wtf?

`payload.wtf` is a Solana-compatible API that:

- Accepts standard base64-encoded `sendTransaction` payloads  
- Enforces a tip-based routing policy  
- Routes transactions to high-performance RPC providers like QuickNode, Helius, or Jito  
- Drops transactions that don't meet tip thresholds  
- Logs telemetry for land rate, block inclusion rate, and tip volume  

All without changing your Solana codebase â€” just send to a new endpoint.

## ðŸ§° SDKs

| Language | Repo | Package |
|----------|------|---------|
| TypeScript / Node.js | [web3-sdk](https://github.com/payloadwtf/web3-sdk) | `@payload-wtf/web3` |
| Python | [python-sdk](https://github.com/payloadwtf/python-sdk) | `payload_wtf` |
| Rust | [rust-sdk](https://github.com/payloadwtf/rust-sdk) | `payload-wtf-sdk` |

## ðŸ§  Example Use Case

```ts
import { sendPayloadTransaction } from "@payload-wtf/web3";

const signature = await sendPayloadTransaction(connection, transaction, {
  tipLamports: 100_000,
  mode: "jito", // or "quicknode", "helius"
});
```

Behind the scenes, we:
- Append a `SystemProgram.transfer()` to your tip wallet
- Serialize and forward to `https://api.payload.wtf/sendTransaction`
- Return the tx signature (or drop with a 403 if tip is missing)
